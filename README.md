## React To-Do App

This is a small project I did to practice some fundamentals of React. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as complete, update task titles, sort tasks, delete individual tasks, and delete all tasks.

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Sort tasks alphabetically, by input order or by completed status
- Delete all tasks at once using the 'Delete All' button
